I still don't know how to use a coroutine :| I know it is an async function using an enum but I have no idea how to implement it via puzzle :(

 The puzzle swap is valid and no testing is needed for this, but I need to implement Coroutine for shuffle pieces (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L9ksCs6MbE)
 I hope it will be without more problemsâ€¦
